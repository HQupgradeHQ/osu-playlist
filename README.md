```python
import osu_playlist
from osu_playlist import osudict, names, namedict

print(len(names))
# this will filter taglines matching azer or step 
first_search = osu_playlist.filter_tags(osudict, regtag="(azer|step") 
print(first_search)
# this will filter taglines from first_search matching drumstep 
second_search = osu_playlist.filter_tags(
    osudict, regtag="drumstep", list_of_song_names=first_search
)
print(second_search)
