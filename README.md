## Example  with [mpv](https://mpv.io/):
  `mpv --playlist=playlist.m3u8 --shuffle --volume 35` 
## Example regex search + inverse + to directory:
 `python3 osu_playlist.py -r "(azer|step)" -i -d "E:/music/osu_playlist"`

`-r "(azer|step)"` will match all songs which contain azer or step

`-i` (optional) return an inverted result , all songs which NOT contain azer or step

`-d` (optional) export .mp3 to directory E:/music/osu_playlist

# Using osu_playlist.py as a library
```python
import osu_playlist
from osu_playlist import osudict, names, namedict

print(len(names))
# this will filter taglines matching azer or step 
first_search = osu_playlist.filter_tags(osudict, regtag="(azer|step") 
print(first_search)
# this will filter taglines from first_search matching drumstep 
second_search = osu_playlist.filter_tags(
    osudict, regtag="drumstep", list_of_song_names=first_search
)
print(second_search)
# export to dir
osu_playlist.export_to_dir(second_search)
```
